We have an intern to gather contacts for us, however Millionpodcasts really brought our outreach to another level! I opted in for a list of coffee podcasts, as we put out a study on the Best Coffee Cities, and was given over the amount we paid for as well as a lot of very useful social media information. It would have taken our intern months to gather this information, but we were able to access it instantly!! Would recommend this service, especially if you are looking for niche contacts that can't be easily found on Muckrack or Cision!"
